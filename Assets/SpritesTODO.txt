playersheet.png
	4 more rows with idle animation for each direction

spacezombie.png
	same size as player, a space zombie in space clothes that is chases the player

battery.png
	battery pickup item
	can animate to glow  or flash if you want

engine.png
	engine part trying to find to fix escape pod

laser.png
	animated laser we can shoot

batterymeter.png
	displays how much battery is left
	32x32 (size up for debate)
	first column is empty battery
	others adds one more bar
	5 bars is full

healthmeter.png
	displays health state
	32x32 (size up for debate)
	first column is red health, then middle health (yellow prolly), and full health (green prolly)

hologramborder.png
	(size up for debate)
	ok our idea was to have it so when you press a button he would project a hologram displaying either his battery meter or health so the batterymeter health meter and hologram should work together to look like maybe a light blue hologram thingy maybe animate border so it looks flickery (could even have healthmeter and batterymeter have animation for each and animated for flickery)

objecttileset.png
	(32x32 each tile)
	using this to help build objects for rooms would have:
	X for wall
	picture of zombie 
	battery
	engine
	Left arrow
	Right arrow
	Up arrow
	Down arrow

tileset.png
	32x32 for each tile
	a tileset for a space ship environment

	environment ideas:
	(1) Airlock
	(2) Natural Botanical Gardens and Aquarium
	(3) Engine Room
	(4) Science Laboratories
	(5) Living Quarters
	(6) Cafeteria
	(7) Central Command and Bridge
	(8) Cloning Facility
	(9) Enrichment Facility
	(10) Casino

	Can all be one spritesheet

	for this weekend: get atleast a generic spaceship environment done


complete.png

	no clue what to do here

gameover.png

	dan was thinking of having an animation of cs-499 dying or something under a spotlight

titlebackground.png
	
	space background

titlecs-499.png (size idk)
	have CS-499 mining spacerock (would be cool if animated)

titlesk-27.png (size idk)
	SK-27 floating in the background (maybe animated flashing lights)

	titlecs-499.png and titlesk-27.png are going to be placed on titlebackground and moved around a bit to produce a floating effect
	Size is appropriate to however small they need to be to have title.png and the buttons still on title screen

paused.png

	paused seems fine to me unless you want to do a new font

title.png

	just title of game
